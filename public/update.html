<h1>Thanks for using the Patreon Downloader</h1>
<h2>What's up</h2>
<p>This extension is a labour of love for me. I programmed this it to solve a problem that I had. Archiving the photos from patreon creators. I needed a way to scrape slideshows from the responsive html which turned out to be a much more difficult task than I originally thought. I released this plugin on the chrome web store in case it was useful for anyone else. It's an open source project. Feel free to contribute or report bugs at to at github.

<h3>What this extension does.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Downloads files linked in posts</li>
    <li>Downloads the post header image</li>
    <li>Attempts to mimic a user to scrape and download slideshows</li>
    <li>Saves the text and comments from a post</li>
</ul>

    <li>Download streaming video</li>

<h2>What's new in version 0.1.1</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Gitlab link added</li>
    <li>Its is now possible to send files to the downloader without waiting for the popup. This was breaking the extension if the user navigated away from the page while scraping</li>

</ul>
<h2>What's new in version 0.1.0</h2>
<ul>
